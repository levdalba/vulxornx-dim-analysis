for handling more complex drawing use advanced OCR models, contour-based line detection
and automatic scale estimation. Support multiple formats, apply noise reduction, 
and optimize with GPU acceleration for efficiency!


Instead of relying on the Hough Line Transform, we can use mix of contour detection and 
deep learning-based edge detection to better handle irregular or dashed dimension lines. Instead 
of manually setting a scale factor, dynamic scale estimation can be used by identifying known reference 
dimensions within the drawing, making the process more accurate and adaptable.
